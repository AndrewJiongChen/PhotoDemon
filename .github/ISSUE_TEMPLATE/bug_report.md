name: Bug report
about: Thank you for helping me improve PhotoDemon!

---

### Let's start with version information
 - PhotoDemon version from Help > About, e.g. "PhotoDemon 7.2 pre-alpha (build 500)"
 - Windows Version (e.g. "Windows 10")

### Please describe the bug
What problem did you encounter?

### Expected behavior
Please describe what *should* happen.  (This helps me know what a fix might look like.)

### How to reproduce the bug
The more detailed, the better!  If at all possible, a list works best, e.g.:
   1. Go to '...'
   2. Click on '....'
   3. Scroll down to '....'
   4. See error

### Debug logs
If you are using a nightly build, or if PhotoDemon has crashed more than once, it will automatically generate Debug Logs inside the PhotoDemon/Data/Debug folder.  If you can find the *most recent* debug log in this folder and copy+paste its contents into this bug report, that is a *huge* help.  

### Sample images and screenshots
If applicable, please attach the image file(s) that caused the bug.  Similarly, feel free to attach any screenshots that can help describe the problem.

### Thank you for your contribution!

If you can continue following this issue as I work on a fix, I'll happily add your name to PhotoDemon's contributor list.  Just let me know what name and/or URL you'd like me to use.  Thank you!
