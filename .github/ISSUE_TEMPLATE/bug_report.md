### Version information
 - PhotoDemon version from Help > About, e.g. "PhotoDemon 7.2 pre-alpha (build 500)"
 - Windows Version (e.g. "Windows 10")

### Describe the bug
What problem did you encounter?

### How to reproduce the bug
The more detailed, the better!  If at all possible, a list works best, e.g.:
   1. Go to '...'
   2. Click on '....'
   3. Scroll down to '....'
   4. Etc

### Expected behavior
Please describe what *should* happen.  (This helps me know what a fix might look like.)

### Debug logs
If you are using a nightly build, or if PhotoDemon has crashed more than once, it will automatically generate Debug Logs inside the program's Data/Debug folder.  If you can find the *most recent* debug log in this folder (with a filename like "DebugReport_1.log") and attach it to this bug report, that is a *huge* help.  

### Sample images and/or screenshots
If applicable, please attach the image file(s) that caused the bug.  Similarly, feel free to attach any screenshots that help describe the problem.

### Thank you!

Please follow-up with this issue as I work on a fix.  As a "thank you", I'm happy to add your name to PhotoDemon's contributor list.  Just let me know what name and/or URL you'd like to use.
