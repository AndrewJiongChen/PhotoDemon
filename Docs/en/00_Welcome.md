Welcome to the official PhotoDemon documentation. 

Documentation is primarily sorted by PhotoDemon menu order.  The menu on the left side of this page mimics PhotoDemon's main menu, so you can easily look up any individual tool or function.

Contributions to documentation are always welcome.  The preferred method of contributing changes is via [PhotoDemon's GitHub repository](https://github.com/tannerhelland/PhotoDemon).  For small corrections or fixes, sending a message via the [PhotoDemon contact page](http://photodemon.org/about/contact/) is fine too.
