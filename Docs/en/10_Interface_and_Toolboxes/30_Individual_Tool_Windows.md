PhotoDemon tool windows follow a standard pattern:

(image of tool window, with regions marked as 1 - Preview area, 2 - Tool options, 3 - Command bar)

### 1: Preview area

The preview area of a tool displays a live sample of how the image (or currently selection image region) would be affected by the current tool options.  

All previews provide an option to toggle between the original image, and a preview of the tool effect.  This can be helpful for seeing subtle differences caused by the current tool.

Some tools may provide additional preview options:

- A *zoom button* in the bottom-right.  
    This button allows you to switch between a preview of the full image, shrunk to fit the window, and a section of the window at 100% zoom.  Because most images do not fit in the preview area when viewed at 100%, you are allowed to click-drag the image and move it around while in this mode.
	
	Some tools do not allow you to switch out of *fit full image* mode.  This is because the filter only works if it has access to the entire image (such as the "rotate image" tool).
	
- Set tool options by clicking the preview window.
    This feature will vary from tool to tool, but two of the most common features include:
	
	- Click to set center point for effect.  Some tools, like the Vignetting style effect, operate around a "center point".  On these tools, you can click the preview window to select a center area.
	- Click to select color from image.  Some tools, like the Green screen tool, allow you to specify a color to be operated on.  In these tools, it is often most convenient to simply select a color from the preview image by clicking it.  (If this mode is available, hovering the mouse over the image will cause the preview effect to temporarily disappear, so you can select a color.)
	
	Other options may be available in certain tool dialogs; refer to that tool's documentation for details.
	
### 2: Command Bar
