'Last update: added mechanism for version checking
'
'Module for handling all pngnq-s9 interfacing.  This module is pointless without the accompanying
' pngnq-s9 plugin, which will be in the App/PhotoDemon/Plugins subdirectory as "pngnq-s9.exe"
'
'pngnq-s9 is a modified, much-improved variant of the free, open-source pngnq tool.  You can learn more
' about the original pngnq at:
'
' http://pngnq.sourceforge.net/
'
'...and more about pngnq-s9 specifically at:
'
' http://sourceforge.net/projects/pngnqs9/
'
'This project was designed against v2.0.1 of the pngnq-s9 tool (16 Oct '12).  It may not work with
' other versions of the tool.  Additional documentation regarding the use of pngnq-s9 is available
' as part of the official pngnq-s9 zip, downloadable from http://sourceforge.net/projects/pngnqs9/files/
