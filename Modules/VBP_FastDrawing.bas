'Last update: preview objects now handle their own rendering; this allows us to delay rendering during special preview events, like
'              color selection on a preview window
'
'This interface provides API support for the main image interaction routines. It assigns memory data
' into a useable array, and later transfers that array back into memory.  Very fast, very compact, can't
' live without it. These functions are arguably the most integral part of PhotoDemon.
