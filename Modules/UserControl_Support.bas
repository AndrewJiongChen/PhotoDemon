'The tab key presents a particular problem when intermixing API windows and VB controls.  VB (obviously) ignores the
' API windows entirely, and PD further complicates this by sometimes mixing API windows and VB controls on the same UC.
' To avoid this disaster, we manage our own tab key presses using an automated system that sorts controls from top-left
' to bottom-right, and automatically figures out tab order from there.
'
'To make sure the automated system works correctly, some controls actually raise a TabPress event, which their parent
' UC can use to cycle control focus within the UC.  When focus is tabbed-out from the last control on the UC, the UC
' itself can then notify the master TabHandler to pass focus to an entirely new control.
