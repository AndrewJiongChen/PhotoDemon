'Last update: when only saving relevant metadata, remove useless padding tags.  Also, a new function for quickly
'              caching binary metadata.
'
'Module for handling all ExifTool interfacing.  This module is pointless without the accompanying ExifTool plugin,
' which can be found in the App/PhotoDemon/Plugins subdirectory as "exiftool.exe".  The ExifTool plugin is
' available by default in all versions of PhotoDemon after and including 6.0.
'
'ExifTool is a comprehensive image metadata handler written by Phil Harvey.  No DLL or VB-compatible library is
' available, so PhotoDemon relies on the stock Windows ExifTool executable file for all interfacing.  You can read
' more about ExifTool at its homepage:
'
'http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/
'
'stdout is piped so PhotoDemon can read ExifTool output in real-time.  I used a sample VB module as a reference
' while developing this code, courtesy of Michael Wandel:
'
'http://owl.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/modExiftool_101.zip
'
'...as well as a modified piping function, derived from code originally written by Joacim Andersson:
'
'http://www.vbforums.com/showthread.php?364219-Classic-VB-How-do-I-shell-a-command-line-program-and-capture-the-output
'
'This project was originally designed against v9.37 of ExifTool (14 Sep '13).  While I do test newer versions, it's
' impossible to test all metadata possibilities, so problems may arise if used with other versions of the software.
' Additional documentation regarding the use of ExifTool can be found in the official ExifTool package, downloadable
' from http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/
