'Last update: added function for returning PhotoDemon's current memory usage
'
'Sometimes, PhotoDemon needs to query Windows for OS-specific data - such as the current version of Windows, or the
' available RAM on the system.  This module handles such calls.
'
'Special thanks goes to Mike Raynder, who wrote the original version of the process-specific memory function.  You can
' download a copy of Mike's original code from this link (good as of 27 Nov '12): http://www.xtremevbtalk.com/showthread.php?t=229758
