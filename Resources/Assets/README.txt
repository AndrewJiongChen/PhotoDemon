If you want to change PhotoDemon's resource file, you first need to modify the PD_icons.rc resource script.  Then you 
 need to recompile the .RES file using Microsoft's rc.exe and rcdll.dll files.  You must then manually add a manifest 
 to the resource file using the instructions at this link:

I cannot provide more support than this, as PhotoDemon is only designed to work with its original resource file.
 I cannot guarantee that a modified resource file will be compatible with the project, and I do not suggest modifying 
 the precompiled resource file in any way.
