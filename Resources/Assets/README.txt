This folder contains the raw resources compiled into PhotoDemon's primary resource file.  

IMPORTANT NOTE: the files in this directory MAY NOT BE LICENSED UNDER THE SAME BSD LICENSE AS PHOTODEMON.

Some of the files in this directory are my own creation, but many have been adopted from other open source projects.  
 If you want to use any of these files in your own project, you first need to contact me for licensing information.  
 I can tell you which images come from which projects, and what their licensing details are.

I can be contacted via the following link:

If you want to change PhotoDemon's resource file, you first need to modify the PD_icons.rc resource script.  Then you 
 need to recompile the .RES file using Microsoft's rc.exe and rcdll.dll files.  You must then manually add a manifest 
 to the resource file using the instructions at this link:

I cannot provide more support than this, as PhotoDemon is only designed to work with its original resource file.
 I cannot guarantee that a modified resource file will be compatible with the project, and I do not suggest modifying 
 the precompiled resource file in any way.  These assets are primarily provided for backup reasons, in case my local 
 repository is lost or corrupted.
