' - A comprehensive backup system for the original file, which this function will use to undo the replace operation if anything
'    goes wrong during the replacement process.
' - Support for a newFile checksum (adler32, as generated by a pdPackage object, which the caller must have initiated with zLib support).
'    - It is assumed that the caller has already verified that this checksum is valid for the new file.

'       - First, if the checksum matches the oldFile, the replace step is skipped (as the files are identical)
'       - Second, if the replacement process reports success, this checksum is validated AGAIN on the destination file.  This verifies that
