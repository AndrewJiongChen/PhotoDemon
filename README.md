PhotoDemon provides a comprehensive photo editor in a 14 MB download.  It runs on any Windows PC (XP through Win 10) and it *does not* require installation.  It runs just fine from a USB stick, SD card, or portable drive.

PhotoDemon is open-source and available under a permissive [BSD license](#licensing).  Contributors have translated the program into more than a dozen languages.

You can support PhotoDemon's ongoing development [through Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/photodemon) or [with a one-time donation](https://photodemon.org/donate/).

## What makes PhotoDemon unique?

### Lightweight and completely portable
No installer is provided or required.  Aside from a temporary folder – which you can specify from the Tools > Options menu – PhotoDemon leaves no trace on your hard drive.  Many users run PhotoDemon from a USB stick or portable drive.

### Integrated macro recording and batch processing
Complex editing actions can be recorded as macros (similar to Office software).  A built-in batch processor lets you apply macros to entire folders of images.

### Usability is paramount
Many open-source photo editors are usability nightmares.  PhotoDemon tries not to be.  Small touches like real-time effect previews, save/load presets on all tools, unlimited Undo/Redo, "Fade last action", keyboard accelerators, mouse wheel and X-button support, and descriptive icons make it fast and easy to use.

### Pro-grade features and tools
* Extensive file format support, including Adobe Photoshop (PSD) images and all major camera RAW formats
* Color-managed workflow, including full support for embedded ICC profiles
* Advanced multi-layer support, including editable text layers and non-destructive layer modifications 
* On-canvas tools: digital paintbrushes, clone and pattern brushes, interactive gradients, and more
* Adjustment tools: levels, curves, HDR, shadow/highlight recovery, white balance, Wratten filters, and many more
* Filters and effects: perspective correction, edge detection, noise removal, real-time content-aware blur, unsharp masking, green screen, lens diffraction, vignetting, and many more
* More than 200 tools are provided in the current build.

### Limitations

* PhotoDemon isn't designed for operating systems other than Microsoft Windows.  A compatibility layer like [Wine](http://www.winehq.org/) may allow it to work on OSX, Linux, or BSD systems, but program stability and performance may suffer.
