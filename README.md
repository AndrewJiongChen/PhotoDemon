## What makes PhotoDemon unique?

### Lightweight and completely portable
No installer is provided or required.  Aside from a temporary file folder – which you can specify from the Tools > Options menu – it leaves no trace on your hard drive.  Many people choose to run PhotoDemon from a USB stick or memory card.

### Integrated macro recording and batch processing
Complex editing actions can be recorded as macros (similar to Office software).  An integrated batch processor allows you to apply macros to entire folders or sets of images.

### Usability is paramount
Many open-source photo editors are usability nightmares.  PhotoDemon tries not to be.  Small touches like save/load presets on all tools, unlimited Undo/Redo, "Fade last action", keyboard accelerators, effect previews, mouse wheel and X-button support, and descriptive menu icons make it quick and easy to use.

### Pro-grade features and tools
* Extensive file format support, including all major RAW formats
* Color-managed workflow, including full support for embedded ICC profiles
* Non-destructive editing for select features, including resizing, rotation, and common adjustments
* 2D transformations: advanced rescale operators (Sinc, Catmull-Rom, etc), content-aware scaling (seam carving), crop, rotate, shear, zoom, tiling
* Adjustment tools: levels, curves, HDR, white balance, split-toning, sepia, full-featured histogram, green screen, Wratten filters, and many more
* Filters and effects: perspective correction, edge detection, noise removal, content-aware blur, unsharp masking, lens diffraction, vignetting, film grain, and many more
* 150+ tools are provided in the current build.

### Limitations

* PhotoDemon isn't designed for OSes other than Microsoft Windows.  A compatibility layer like Wine (http://www.winehq.org/) may allow it to work on OSX, Linux, or BSD systems, but program stability and performance may suffer.

### Contributions
PhotoDemon is maintained by a single individual with a family to support.  The software is provided free-of-charge under a permissive open-source license.
