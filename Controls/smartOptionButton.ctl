'PhotoDemon "Smart" Option Button custom control
'Copyright ©2012-2013 by Tanner Helland
'Created: 28/January/13
'Last updated: 13/September/13
'Last update: fix non-96dpi layout issues
'
'Intrinsic VB option buttons have a number of limitations.  Most obnoxious is the lack of an "autosize" for the caption.
' Now that PhotoDemon has full translation support, option buttons are frequently resized at run-time, and if a
' translated phrase is longer than the original one, the text may be cut off.
'
'So I wrote my own replacement option button.  This option button has a few important benefits:
' 1) Autosize based on the caption is properly supported.
' 2) A hand cursor is automatically applied, and clicks on both the button and label are registered properly.
' 3) The text forecolor can be changed even when a manifest is applied, unlike regular option buttons.
' 4) Subclassing is used to make the option button properly transparent - but only when compiled.
' 5) Font changes are automatically handled internally.
'
'Note that some odd workarounds are required to handle quirks of the way VB treats focus events for option buttons.
' If an option button is the only one in a container, when it receives focus, it will automatically have its value
' set to TRUE.  This obviously doesn't work for our control, which has a single option button in its container.
'
'I work around this by using a hidden check box to receive focus initially.  The user control is still drawn as
' "in focus" (via caption underlining in the IDE), despite a hidden control receiving focus.  If the spacebar is
' used to toggle the option button value, we also handle this properly.
'
'One other quirk of VB option buttons is that whenever they are set to TRUE, their TabStop value is also set to
' TRUE.  We forcibly return it to FALSE - otherwise, the user would have to tab through both the option button
' and the check box on each user control, and we don't want that.
